## `/tools.grunt` Grunt tasks

This folder contains grunt tasks to be used during development, and when producing a publish package.

In order to use GruntJs, it is necessary to:
* install [NodeJs and its npm](https://nodejs.org/) (Node Package Manager)
* install the [Grunt-cli](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started)

The recommended way is to install NodeJs using the installer, then to install Grunt-cli from a command line, with:
```
npm install -g grunt-cli
```
